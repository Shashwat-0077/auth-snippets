// export const db = new PrismaClient();

// This will cause issues and giv warning like Too many clients are running
// so we store the PrismaClient in the globalThis because globalThis is affected by the Next.js hot reload
// so if their is already a PrismaClient running in the globalThis, we can use that
export const db = globalThis.prisma || new PrismaClient();

// and if we are in Development mode or another mode other than Production, we can assign the running PrismaClient to the globalThis.prisma so we can check for it later in hot reload
